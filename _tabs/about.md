To the person building this:

Don't forget what this space represents. It's a monument to your curiosity and proof that you chose to create instead of just consume.

The challenges will be great, but your resolve is greater. Look back at these pages on tough days and remember: you are capable, you are learning, and you are becoming the person you set out to be.
